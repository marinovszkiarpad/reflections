How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It sows differences betwween fies.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

   You can discover possible bugs. E.g. if you change a function and your program goes wrong, you can easily spot the changed function and the cange itself.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You wont save any code that you know that does not work. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    
	git is useful for coing that affects multiple files
	
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

   git log shows all the saved commits. Git diff comapres the two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
